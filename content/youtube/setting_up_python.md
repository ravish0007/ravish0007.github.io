Python is a fun and an amazing programming language.
Its high level, It includes many builtin modules. Endless
community modules to build things.

Instead of asking "What can I do with Python?", a better question would be "What can't I do with Python?"

I don't want to dive into details where Python doesn't fit. But it fits almost everywhere.

You can write Python programs that automate tasks for you, analyze data, do web programming, program hardwares to do cool stuff. Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and the things that tickle your fancy.

In this video, I'll demonstrate on how to setup a basic python development environment. Consists of a Terminal, Python itself and a code editor named Zed.
