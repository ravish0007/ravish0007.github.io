title: Youtube Walkthroughs
---

Hi, I have a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ravish-shankar">channel</a>, and I do programming walkthroughs. I'm in middle of figuring out things. 

I have a hacky setup at this point, I use DroidCam and use my mobile as camera source, Davinci Resolve for video editing, I record audio on "Dolby On" app, and merge it to video later. I tried kdenlive, I had some problem with it. I might move to it later.

Currently, I'm working on producing Python Introductory Series and CSPRIMER solutions walkthroughs.
