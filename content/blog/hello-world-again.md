I'm with nighthack now, and I had lost access to source of this blog. Meanwhile I have been tinkering, learning fuctional bits, gave a retry to all the things that were in my mind.

Well, This is a blog post is to put back the online presense. I also went to Debian India conference, made some friends, it was an incredible experience.

Right now, I and my team working towards no code tools, I'm in db-builder team.

And today is my sister's birthday, took a holiday to have fun together and roam around with her.

Until next time, real soonâ€¦ Thanks!
