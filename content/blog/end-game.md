title: End Game of Contextual Flowers

We live in era of the dawn of artificial intelligence systems, or maybe call it a phase of an era, systems that are fiddling in different dimensions of intelligence.

You listen to a song in Youtube Music or Spotify, what not, next thing up, a random song 
appears that fits your mood. Is it random at all?

It predictions, based on the traces we have left.

So, now the new age of generations of similar possible traces, or generative AI, predicting 
some kind of data, that is guessable by human intelligence which recognizes similar patterns 
and appealing to the builtin senses.

What if the end game is getting into your whole bionic memory, extracting all the contexts, 
that is encoded in form of basic chemistry, decoding them and loading up all the contexts that 
our tiny brains have produced so far and feeding it to the Generative AI that predicts all our 
possible thoughts, that might feel random to us, but are not random anymore. 

Is that the end game we are heading to? Although we are still stuck at mimicking human like behaviour and making robots that will be human like servants.

Guess we'll be trying to crack "Artificial Consciousness", and a great man has said, a Consciousness can not be made out of clocks, though we are composed of known elements and we feel state of being aware.

A question to ponder in a thousand years...
