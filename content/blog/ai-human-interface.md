AI is like good thing to have, it reduces search time on the web when we are trying to compose certain things.
It gives you sweet workable parts, but suppresses your thinking capacity by a minute amount everytime.
All one has to do is copy, and paste and evaluate.

I'd like a coin a term, AHI, AI human interface, as stupid as it sounds. An AHI is just middle layer between AI as a function and target solution nirvana.

It is terrible if you become a pure AHI. The one who prompts end goal, copy, paste, repeat. Without activating the thinking mode. Because this particular category is going get replaced by AI again.

So next time, step back from hitting the enter button on the prompt, and enter the thinking mode.
