title: The Real End Game
---


There is light, there is dark and there exist 
a dimension where it can't be described by mere words,
It's not hell nor heaven, not the last stage of heaven,
last stage of hell.

It's the stillness, a state of absolute nothingness, 
its a way to absolute end of the game of lives.

I can only imagine it, fell it by mere mortal brain,
It's not something to be asked, I guess its a grant.

I can only imagine it, feel it by my mere mortal brain,
its not something to be asked, I guess its a grant.
They say its "moksha", but deep down I know, the beautiful thing called as "death" is not a way to it.

Hey Divine Creator, If you are listening with your obvious channels,
I know I'm longing for it, but I'm just a dot around the tiny pebble in your 
grand things of "samsara".

Guide me towards it...

P.S: If you are not the divine creator, kindly ignore my noise.
