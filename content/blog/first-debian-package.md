title: My first Debian package
---

I attended Debconf, Kochi, India. Meeting diverse people with various background taught me lot. It also taught me pain and suffering, seeing a fellow human leave us in between.

Fortunately, I was able to do debian packaging on the side, particularly ruby.

This is a thank you note for Pirate Praveen, and Vinay Keshava for helping me out in doing so.

My first debian package is <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ruby-duo-api">ruby-duo-api</a>.

Thank you Debian.
