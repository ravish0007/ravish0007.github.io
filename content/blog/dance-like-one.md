title: Dance like one
type: blog

The best bit I have picked myself up, so far,
is actually doing the dance moves than studying them.

Sure, It may look like jackass moves but sometimes it works. Hard work and persistence comes in the middle. Keeping the distraction away... 

All the gyan crap away, it works and the "fun" component is mostly coupled with it. 

And that's about it. Well, as they say everything is fruit and salad, except few outliers, or maybe the layers of underneath are again fruit and salad.

Here is a whole new evolution, that feels so normal, but has taken so many mixes 
to evolve into this stage.

Without any layer underneath, the whole diverse economy of consciousness seizes to exist.

Drama aside, the languages of all forms that both formal and informal has driven us into the wild.

The time we are born, we are into a whole new world, and we begin to start perceiving things.
There is no exact degree that all we are perceiving the same thing but there are ranges with complicated mixed boundaries. 

How formally could one describe like love, pain and sorrow.
We all perceive them very differently and we can only imagine it, "Oh, maybe he/she is feeling the same is me", and often we transfer them consciously or subconsciously.

But there comes these weird symbols etched of all kinds into timeless waves of evolution, maybe there are timed but they carry the whole evolution on their other side, without which it seizes to exist, and its going to keep moving to the other side of eternity of eternal dimensions.

I just want to say thank you to all the elements that have composed layer on who knows how many layers, and all the authors/creators ("expressors") of all kind who expressed themselves so that others could create a "fruit and salad" of their own and that I feel this complex emotion, I don't know what it is and sure hell, I'm having fun...
