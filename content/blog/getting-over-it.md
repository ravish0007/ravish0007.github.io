Reminding myself about <a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#the-law-of-triviality">The Law of Triviality</a>,
I decided that I ought to settle for writing, not preplanning of layouts or design or yada yada.
In the past, all my nerdy and geeky broadcasts were nothing but few video clips scattered on my Instagram and disappeared WhatsApp statuses.
After joining <a href="https://foss.training/">Summer Training</a> from <a hred="https://dgplug.org/">dgplug</a> and following their advice on <a href="https://summertraining.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blogging.html">blogging</a>
plus recalling a bit of <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/"> "Portfolio v/s resume"</a> made me write this very post and told myself how cool this was.
