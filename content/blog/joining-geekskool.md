title: Joining GeekSkool
---

I was looking for jobs on hasjobs.co and stumbled upon a post that pointed to GeekSkool, a programming boot camp, which I applied to it later on.

I got a call on next day, and I was told to study the first six chapters of Eloquent JavaScript. After completing it, I went to GeekSkool for a screening test, I almost got failed by not answering “Name inbuilt data types in JS & What’s a Closure?”, I was accompanied by luck on that day. I joined GeekSkool in January 2022.

Fast-forward, I have been going to GeekSkool every day since March. My friends and I solve assignments, present them every Friday to get reviewed. Sometimes reviews are brutal, but assignments are exciting to solve.

So far we have written JSON parser, lisp interpreter and a todo app (clone of GNOME Todos). Recently I wrote an HTTP server, which resembles Express but is very basic.

It’s a lot of mixed feeling with a few personal events lately, going through a loss, a scar for a lifetime, hope it’ll get better in time…
