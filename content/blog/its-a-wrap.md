title: It's a wrap...or is it?
---

I graduated from GeekSkool, with a pending final project, and hoping to complete it on weekends.

The most valuable thing I learned from GeekSkool is not to overthink a project or optimize it prematurely for that matter, the spirit of accomplishing tasks little by little in a progressive manner brings joy and is quite tangible to measure. I like this spirit, and I like to stick with it.

I’ve made a few personal resolutions, one among them is ABC “always be coding” (learning in general). Currently, studying <a href="https://composingprograms.com/">Composing Programs</a>. I’ve created a few repositories to track them. Few more are,

- Setting up a home lab and having a hosted machine
- Write regularly on experiments
- Make some videos with 3b1b’s manimlib for fun

  That’s it, folks!
